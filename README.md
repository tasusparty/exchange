# Exchange system

This is a project plan for our community. The primary idea is for children books and toys exchanging.

Why?
If you got a preschool child and want to provide a chance for children social contact, exchanging books or toys sounds good. Children are easy to got tired of books and toys. Exchanging something would provide our children a chance to communicate with other kids.  

What?
I plan to develop an exchanging system for our community. 

At the beginning, just provide simple functionality: 
a. Publish your own books/toys
b. Pick others' books/toys to exchange
c. Publish community notice

How?
Everything needs to be simple at the beginning. Especially the front-end, I am a back-end developer by now.

The back-end architecture:
Spring boot + mybatis
(In future, Spring boot + Spring cloud + mybatis)

The front-end:
html or node.js ...
(Wechat applet is the final goal)
